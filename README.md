# Zero_SocialLogin

Customers sign in and sign up with Google, Apple or
Facebook (OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0, no third-party libraries), on the
sign-in, registration and checkout pages, and connect or disconnect those
accounts under My Account. Admin sign-in is not affected. Off by default:
Stores > Configuration > Zero > Social Login.

More in the theme's `docs/social-login.md` (https://zerofront.dev/docs).

## Install

Requires Magento Open Source 2.4.7–2.4.9 and PHP 8.2–8.4 with the GD extension built with WebP (`php -r 'var_dump(function_exists("imagewebp"));'` says `true`; Magento's own PHP requirements cover the rest). Without WebP in GD, Zero skips its WebP image copies and serves the originals.

```bash
composer require zerofront/module-zero-social-login
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:di:compile           # production mode
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy # production mode
bin/magento cache:flush
```

Composer installs `zerofront/module-zero-core`, `zerofront/module-zero-checkout` with it.

Part of [`zerofront/zero`](https://zerofront.dev), which installs the Zero theme and every Zero module at once.
